# PN-BisimInspector
PN-BisimInspector is a Bachelor’s thesis project focused on developing a dedicated tool for place bisimilarity analysis within P/T Petri Nets.

## How to use it
To use the tool, you first need to model your Petri Nets. You can use the [Online Petri Net Simulator](https://petrinetsimulator.com). Once your nets are ready:

Export them as .json files.

Rename the files to 'first_net.json' and 'second_net.json'.

Place them inside the nets/ directory.
